# YouCanBuildIt

As a mayor in Cities: Skylines, you know that growth and expansion are crucial for the success of your city.  However, limited finances can 
often hinder progress and stall projects. That's where "You Can Build It" comes in. This mod allows you to keep building your city even when
you've run out of money, without resorting to cheats or unlimited funds.

With "You Can Build It," you can continue constructing roads, zones, and structures, all while taking on debt to fund your projects. However, 
interest will accrue on the negative balance. But don't worry, you have the option to adjust or turn off the interest rate entirely in mod 
configuration. This flexibility means that you can tailor the mod to your own playstyle. If you're looking for a challenge, you can turn up
the interest rate and test your financial management skills. Alternatively, if you want a more relaxed experience, you can turn off interest
and focus on building your dream city without worrying about debt.

Unlike mods that provide unlimited money, "You Can Build It" offers a more engaging and challenging gameplay experience. It allows you to take
on debt to fund your projects, but also keeps you accountable for your spending. This adds a layer of strategic thinking to the game, as you
must carefully balance your income and expenses to ensure the long-term success of your city.

So if you're looking for a way to keep expanding your city, even when funds are low, "You Can Build It" is the solution you've been searching for.
