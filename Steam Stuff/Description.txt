As a mayor in Cities: Skylines, you know that growth and expansion are crucial for the success of your city. However, limited finances can often hinder progress and stall projects. That's where "You Can Build It" comes in. This mod allows you to keep building your city even when you've run out of money, without resorting to cheats or unlimited funds.

With "You Can Build It," you can continue constructing roads, zones, and structures, all while taking on debt to fund your projects. However, interest will accrue on the negative balance. But don't worry, you have the option to adjust or turn off the interest rate entirely in mod configuration. This flexibility means that you can tailor the mod to your own playstyle. If you're looking for a challenge, you can turn up the interest rate and test your financial management skills. Alternatively, if you want a more relaxed experience, you can turn off interest and focus on building your dream city without worrying about debt.

Unlike mods that provide unlimited money, "You Can Build It" offers a more engaging and challenging gameplay experience. It allows you to take on debt to fund your projects, but also keeps you accountable for your spending. This adds a layer of strategic thinking to the game, as you must carefully balance your income and expenses to ensure the long-term success of your city.

So if you're looking for a way to keep expanding your city, even when funds are low, "You Can Build It" is the solution you've been searching for. Download the mod today and start building the city of your dreams, no matter the financial obstacles you face!

Feel free to take this little bit of code and replicate it in another mod (Looking at you GameAnarchy). I wrote this both as an exercise in making a mod and I wanted this functionality, Unless it breaks or I find a bug I do not plan on updating this.
